            <div id="panel1">So you want to re-home your dog and you are willing to keep him/her until placed? We ask that all owners keep their dog until we are able to match him/her with a new family. </div>

            <div id="question2">Why should I re-home my boxer through ABR? </div>
            <div id="panel2">We are often asked why someone should re-home their dog through Austin Boxer Rescue rather than use other avenues. There are many benefits to placing your dog through rescue if you can keep your dog until he/she is placed. For questions about the process that are not answered on this webpage, please email our Intake Coordinator at os@austinboxerrescue.com.</div>

            <div id="questions3">I cannot foster my dog until placed and would like to know if Austin Boxer Rescue can accept him/her into rescue: </div>
            <div id="panel3">If you are seeking intake for your dog into rescue but cannot foster until placed, please send an email to os@austinboxerrescue.com explaining the circumstances in detail. Please understand that few dogs are accepted into rescue in this case. Shelter dogs at risk for euthanasia are considered first. Additionally, a monetary donation may be required to cover boarding expenses. You may also be required to have your dog fully vetted prior to acceptance into the Owner Surrender Program.</div>
